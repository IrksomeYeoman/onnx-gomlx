## Features

- **Easy Conversion**: Convert ONNX models to GoMLX format with minimal effort.
- **Compatibility**: Supports a wide range of ONNX model types.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for speed and performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface for quick usage.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/IrksomeYeoman/onnx-gomlx/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system, and follow the instructions to install.

### Prerequisites

- Go programming language installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

## Usage

Once you have installed the tool, you can convert an ONNX model to GoMLX format using the command line.

### Basic Command

```bash
onnx-gomlx convert <path_to_onnx_model> <output_path>
```

### Example

To convert a model named `model.onnx` and save it as `model.gomlx`, run:

```bash
onnx-gomlx convert model.onnx model.gomlx
```

### Advanced Options

You can also specify additional options for conversion:

- `--optimize`: Optimize the model during conversion.
- `--verbose`: Show detailed output during the conversion process.

## Supported Models

The tool supports various ONNX models, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
- Custom ONNX models (as long as they comply with the ONNX specification)
